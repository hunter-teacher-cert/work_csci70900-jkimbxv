Chapter 4 Exercise 1

1. 
//ping() will print a period and finish the line. 
//baffle() will print wug and then call ping()

No, I wug.
You wugga wug.
I wug. 

2. //I wasn't sure what to do since no variables were assigned so I left the stack diagram 
//blank inside. 
main[]
zoop[]
baffle[]
ping[]

3. If ping was as described, I imagined it like this. 

Public static void ping(){
 System.out.println(".");
 baffle();
}

We'd get an infinite loop. Ping would call baffle and baffle would then call ping which would then call baffle. We'd get a constant loop of 
wug.
wug.
wug.
wug. Etc.
