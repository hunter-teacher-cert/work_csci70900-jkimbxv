Portfolio assignment due 1 week after last class session.

Students are to create two detailed lesson plans, outlines and supporting materials for computer science. The lesson plans and outlines should include a description of the intended student audience and a detailed explanation of how multiple pedagogical techniques can be used in delivering the lesson.

Each lesson plan should demonstrate different pedogogical techniques, though there may be some overlap.

For example, if the lesson includes subgoal labeling, the project should include the finished desired code along with the subgoal labels included within.

The plans can be sequential, or entirely separate.

The plans must also be aligned to the New York State Standards for Digital Fluency and Computer Science.

The completed assignment should be such that the portfolio can be given to any computer science teacher and they could deliver the lessons as intended.
