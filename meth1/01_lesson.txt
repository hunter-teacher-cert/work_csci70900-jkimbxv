## Lesson objective: Students learn how to iterate through arrays

### Aim: How can we ask our computer to repeat actions?

### NY Standards
9-12.CT.3: Refine and visualize complex data sets showing how to tell different stories with the same data set.
9-12.CT.7: Design or remix a program that utilizes a data structure to maintain changes to related pieces of data

### Warm up
time: 5 min: 2 min thinking time, 3 min class discussion
Let's say you were wrapping presents but you have hundreds of them. What might you wish you had? What might make things more efficient?

Introduce the concept of loops as repetitive action
Show documentation and resources of loops
Explain the anatomy of a loop

---

### Lesson Activity part 1
time: 15 minutes
Have students set up loops of various sizes and various incrementation by hand, writing it out & diagramming
Use computers to implement what they wrote out by hand
Have students print out the index using the loops

### Lesson Content part 2
time: 15 minutes
Introduce loops in the context of arrays.
Introduce how indices can be used in loops
Demonstrate construction of an array and a loop that indexes through the array via live coding
Have students comment what each line of the code segment does
Demonstrate Sum of array

### Lesson Activity part 2
time: 20 minutes
Students complete problem set involving various contexts. Ex:
Create a loop that prints out every letter of the alphabet
Linear search
Create an empty array and fill it with numbers
Find Average
