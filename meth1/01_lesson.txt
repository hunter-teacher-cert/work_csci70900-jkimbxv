## Lesson objective: Students learn how to iterate through arrays

### Aim: How can we ask our computer to repeat actions?

### Warm up
time: 5 min: 2 min thinking time, 3 min class discussion
Let's say you were wrapping presents but you have hundreds of them. What might you wish you had? What might make things more efficient?

### Lesson Content part 1
time: 15 minutes
Introduce the concept of loops as repetitive action
Show documentation and resources of loops
Explain the anatomy of a loop

---

### Lesson Activity part 1
time: 15 minutes
Have students set up loops of various sizes and various incrementation by hand, writing it out & diagramming
Use computers to implement what they wrote out by hand
Have students print out the index using the loops

---


### Lesson Content part 2
time: 15 minutes
Introduce loops in the context of arrays.
Introduce how indices can be used in loops
Demonstrate construction of an array and a loop that indexes through the array via live coding
Have students comment what each line of the code segment does
Demonstrate Sum of array

### Lesson Activity part 2
time: 20 minutes
Students complete problem set involving various contexts. Ex:
Create a loop that prints out every letter of the alphabet
Linear search
Create an empty array and fill it with numbers
Find Average

### Closing
time: 10 minutes
Review structure of a loop
Review how to index through a loop
Go over one of the problems
