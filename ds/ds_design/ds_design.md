# DS Design
## 2D ArrayList based design
Alphabetically sorted array list by last name by columns
e.g. column 0 would be all the A names, column 25 would be all the Z names
Each column then is sorted alphabetically.
e.g. column 0 would be Aardvark, Apple, Azure for example

n is the size of a column
What is the runtime for add: O(n)  
What is the runtime for find: O(n lg n)
What is the runtime for remove: O(n)
What is the runtime for printList: O(n^2)

##Phone number extension
method that grabs the area code from each person object
